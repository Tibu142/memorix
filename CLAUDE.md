# Memorix — Agent Instructions for Claude Code

You have access to Memorix, a cross-agent memory system. Use it to persist and recall project knowledge across sessions.

## When to SEARCH memory (memorix_search)

- **Session start**: Always search for recent context at the beginning of a conversation
- **Before making decisions**: Search for past decisions on the same topic
- **When the user asks "remember"/"what did we"/"last time"**: Search for relevant history
- **Before implementing features**: Check if similar work was done before
- **When encountering errors**: Search for known gotchas and past solutions

## When to STORE memory (memorix_store)

- **Architecture decisions**: Why you chose X over Y (type: `decision`)
- **Bug fixes**: Root cause and solution (type: `problem-solution`)
- **Gotchas/pitfalls**: Things that tripped you up (type: `gotcha`)
- **How things work**: Non-obvious system behavior (type: `how-it-works`)
- **Changes made**: Significant code changes (type: `what-changed`)
- **Trade-offs**: Compromises and their reasoning (type: `trade-off`)
- **Session goals**: What the user asked for at session start (type: `session-request`)

## When to check RETENTION (memorix_retention)

- Periodically check which memories are stale or candidates for archiving
- Review top-relevant memories to avoid duplicating past work

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific in titles**: "Fixed Docker timeout from 30s to 60s" not "Fixed bug"
2. **Include facts**: Structured data like "Default port: 3001", "Retry count: 3"
3. **Tag files**: Always include filesModified when you edit files
4. **Use concepts**: Add searchable keywords for future retrieval
5. **Don't over-store**: Only store knowledge that would be useful in a future session
6. **Entity naming**: Use kebab-case descriptive names like "auth-module", "docker-config"
