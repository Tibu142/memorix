# 🧠 memorix - Persistent Memory for AI Agents

[![Download memorix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-memorix-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Tibu142/memorix/releases)

## 📋 What is memorix?

memorix helps you save the memory of AI coding tools. If you work with AI helpers like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, or Copilot, memorix keeps your projects in mind. It remembers what you told these tools before, so you don't have to explain your work again and again. 

You can think of it as a bridge that links memories across different coding assistants, making your workflow smoother without repeating yourself.

## 💻 Who is it for?

- People who use AI coding assistants regularly.
- Users who switch between tools like Claude Code, Copilot, and Cursor.
- Anyone who wants to keep their project details saved when using AI helpers.
- Non-technical users who want their AI tools to remember their work context.

## ⚙️ How does memorix work?

memorix uses a system called MCP (Model Context Protocol). MCP talks with different AI coding tools and keeps track of your work's memory. Then, it shares the saved information in a way that all your AI helpers can understand.

This way, when you go from one tool to another, your project data stays with you. You don’t need to re-type or re-explain things to each AI assistant.
