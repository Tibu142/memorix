## 😤 Stop Re-Explaining Your Project

Your AI assistant forgets everything when you start a new chat. You spend 10 minutes re-explaining your architecture. **Again.** And if you switch from Cursor to Claude Code? Everything is gone. **Again.**

| Without Memorix | With Memorix |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Session 2:** "What's our tech stack?" | **Session 2:** "I remember — Next.js with Prisma and tRPC. What should we build next?" |
| **Switch IDE:** All context lost | **Switch IDE:** Context follows you instantly |
| **New team member's AI:** Starts from zero | **New team member's AI:** Already knows the codebase |
| **After 50 tool calls:** Context explodes, restart needed | **After restart:** Picks up right where you left off |
| **MCP configs:** Copy-paste between 7 IDEs manually | **MCP configs:** One command syncs everything |

**Memorix solves all of this.** One MCP server. Seven agents. Zero context loss.

---

## ⚡ Get Started in 30 Seconds

Add this to your agent's MCP config file, restart — done:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memorix": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memorix@latest", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

> 📖 **Where is my config file?** → [Full setup guide for all 7 agents](docs/SETUP.md)
> Windsurf • Cursor • Claude Code • Codex • VS Code Copilot • Antigravity • Kiro

That's it. No API keys. No cloud accounts. No dependencies. Just works.

---

## 🎬 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cross-Session Memory

```
Monday morning — You and Cursor discuss auth architecture:
  You: "Let's use JWT with refresh tokens, 15-minute expiry"
  → Memorix auto-stores this as a 🟤 decision

Tuesday — New Cursor session:
  You: "Add the login endpoint"
  → AI calls memorix_search("auth") → finds Monday's decision
  → "Got it, I'll implement JWT with 15-min refresh tokens as we decided"
  → Zero re-explaining!
```

### Scenario 2: Cross-Agent Collaboration

```
You use Windsurf for backend, Claude Code for reviews:

  Windsurf: You fix a tricky race condition in the payment module
  → Memorix stores it as a 🟡 problem-solution with the fix details

  Claude Code: "Review the payment module"
  → AI calls memorix_search("payment") → finds the race condition fix
  → "I see there was a recent race condition fix. Let me verify it's correct..."
  → Knowledge transfers seamlessly between agents!
```

### Scenario 3: Gotcha Prevention

```
Week 1: You hit a painful Windows path separator bug
  → Memorix stores it as a 🔴 gotcha: "Use path.join(), never string concat"

Week 3: AI is about to write `baseDir + '/' + filename`
  → Session-start hook injected the gotcha into context
  → AI writes `path.join(baseDir, filename)` instead
  → Bug prevented before it happened!
```

### Scenario 4: Workspace Sync Across IDEs

```
You have 12 MCP servers configured in Cursor.
Now you want to try Kiro.

  You: "Sync my workspace to Kiro"
  → memorix_workspace_sync scans Cursor's MCP configs
  → Generates Kiro-compatible .kiro/settings/mcp.json
  → Also syncs your rules, skills, and workflows
  → Kiro is ready in seconds, not hours!
```

### Scenario 5: Auto-Generated Project Skills

```
After 2 weeks of development, you have 50+ observations:
  - 8 gotchas about Windows path issues
  - 5 decisions about the auth module
  - 3 problem-solutions for database migrations

  You: "Generate project skills"
  → memorix_skills clusters observations by entity
  → Auto-generates SKILL.md files:
    - "auth-module-guide.md" — JWT setup, refresh flow, common pitfalls
    - "database-migrations.md" — Prisma patterns, rollback strategies
  → Syncs skills to any agent: Cursor, Claude Code, Kiro...
  → New team members' AI instantly knows your project's patterns!
```

## 🧠 What Memorix Can Do

### Smart Memory (17 MCP Tools)

| What You Say | What Memorix Does |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Remember this architecture decision" | `memorix_store` — Classifies as 🟤 decision, extracts entities, creates graph relations |
| "What did we decide about auth?" | `memorix_search` → `memorix_detail` — 3-layer progressive disclosure, ~10x token savings |
| "What happened around that bug fix?" | `memorix_timeline` — Shows chronological context before/after |
| "Show me the knowledge graph" | `memorix_dashboard` — Opens interactive web UI with D3.js graph |
| "Which memories are getting stale?" | `memorix_retention` — Exponential decay scores, identifies archive candidates |

### Cross-Agent Workspace Sync

| What You Say | What Memorix Does |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Sync my MCP servers to Kiro" | `memorix_workspace_sync` — Migrates configs, merges (never overwrites) |
| "Check my agent rules" | `memorix_rules_sync` — Scans 7 agents, deduplicates, detects conflicts |
| "Generate rules for Cursor" | `memorix_rules_sync` — Cross-format conversion (`.mdc` ↔ `CLAUDE.md` ↔ `.kiro/steering/`) |
| "Generate project skills" | `memorix_skills` — Creates SKILL.md from observation patterns |
| "Inject the auth skill" | `memorix_skills` — Returns skill content directly into agent context |

### Knowledge Graph (MCP Official Compatible)

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `create_entities` | Build your project's knowledge graph |
| `create_relations` | Connect entities with typed edges (causes, fixes, depends_on) |
| `add_observations` | Attach observations to entities |
| `search_nodes` / `open_nodes` | Query the graph |
| `read_graph` | Export full graph for visualization |

> **Drop-in compatible** with [MCP Official Memory Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) — same API, more features.

### 9 Observation Types

Every memory is classified for intelligent retrieval:

| Icon | Type | When To Use |
|------|------|-------------|
| 🎯 | `session-request` | Original task/goal for this session |
| 🔴 | `gotcha` | Critical pitfall — "Never do X because Y" |
| 🟡 | `problem-solution` | Bug fix with root cause and solution |
| 🔵 | `how-it-works` | Technical explanation of a system |
| 🟢 | `what-changed` | Code/config change record |
| 🟣 | `discovery` | New insight or finding |
| 🟠 | `why-it-exists` | Rationale behind a design choice |
| 🟤 | `decision` | Architecture/design decision |
| ⚖️ | `trade-off` | Compromise with pros/cons |

### Visual Dashboard

Run `memorix_dashboard` to open a web UI at `http://localhost:3210`:

- **Interactive Knowledge Graph** — D3.js force-directed visualization of entities and relations
- **Observation Browser** — Filter by type, search with highlighting, expand/collapse details
- **Retention Panel** — See which memories are active, stale, or candidates for archival
- **Project Switcher** — View any project's data without switching IDEs
- **Batch Cleanup** — Auto-detect and bulk-delete low-quality observations
- **Light/Dark Theme** — Premium glassmorphism design, bilingual (EN/中文)

### Auto-Memory Hooks

Memorix can **automatically capture** decisions, errors, and gotchas from your coding sessions:

```bash
memorix hooks install    # One-command setup
```

- **Implicit Memory** — Detects patterns like "I decided to...", "The bug was caused by...", "Never use X"
- **Session Start Injection** — Loads recent high-value memories into agent context automatically
- **Multi-Language** — English + Chinese keyword matching
- **Smart Filtering** — 30s cooldown, skips trivial commands (ls, cat, pwd)

## 🔮 Optional: Vector Search

Out of the box, Memorix uses BM25 full-text search (already great for code). Add semantic search with one command:

```bash
# Option A: Native speed (recommended)
npm install -g fastembed

# Option B: Universal compatibility
npm install -g @huggingface/transformers
```

With vector search, queries like "authentication" also match memories about "login flow" via semantic similarity. Both run **100% locally** — zero API calls, zero cost.

---

## 🔒 Project Isolation

- **Auto-detected** — Project identity from `git remote` URL, zero config needed
- **Per-project storage** — `~/.memorix/data/<owner--repo>/` per project
- **Scoped search** — Defaults to current project; `scope: "global"` to search all
- **Zero cross-contamination** — Project A's decisions never leak into project B

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I keep context when switching between Cursor and Claude Code?**
Install Memorix in both IDEs. They share the same local memory directory — architecture decisions made in Cursor are instantly searchable in Claude Code. No cloud sync needed.

**How do I prevent my AI from forgetting previous sessions?**
Memorix stores observations persistently on disk. Next session, the AI calls `memorix_search` and retrieves prior decisions, gotchas, and knowledge. With auto-memory hooks, it even captures context automatically.

**How do I sync MCP server configs between IDEs?**
Run `memorix_workspace_sync` with action `"migrate"` and your target IDE. It scans source configs and generates compatible configs for the target — merges, never overwrites.

**How do I migrate from Cursor to Windsurf / Kiro / Claude Code?**
Memorix workspace sync migrates MCP configs, agent rules (`.mdc` ↔ `CLAUDE.md` ↔ `.kiro/steering/`), skills, and workflows. One command, seconds to complete.

**Is there an MCP server for persistent AI coding memory?**
Yes — Memorix is a cross-agent memory MCP server supporting 7 IDEs with knowledge graph, 3-layer progressive disclosure search, workspace sync, and auto-generated project skills.

**How is this different from mcp-memory-service?**
Both are great memory servers. Memorix adds: cross-agent workspace sync (MCP configs, rules, skills), auto-generated project skills from memory patterns, 3-layer token-efficient search, and session-start memory injection hooks.

**Does it work offline / locally?**
Yes, 100%. All data stored in `~/.memorix/data/`. No cloud, no API keys, no external services. Optional vector search also runs locally via ONNX/WASM.
