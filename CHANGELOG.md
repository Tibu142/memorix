# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Memory-Driven Skills Engine** (`memorix_skills` MCP tool):
  - `list` — Discover all `SKILL.md` files across 7 agent directories
  - `generate` — Auto-generate project-specific skills from observation patterns (gotchas, decisions, how-it-works)
  - `inject` — Return full skill content directly to agent context
  - Intelligent scoring: requires skill-worthy observation types, not just volume
  - Write to any target agent with `write: true, target: "<agent>"`
- **Transformers.js Embedding Provider**:
  - Pure JavaScript fallback (`@huggingface/transformers`) — no native deps required
  - Provider chain: `fastembed` → `transformers.js` → fulltext-only
  - Quantized model (`q8`) for small footprint
- **Dashboard Enhancements**:
  - Canvas donut chart for observation type distribution
  - Embedding provider status card (enabled/provider/dimensions)
  - Search result highlighting with `<mark>` tags
- **17 new tests** for Skills Engine (list, generate, inject, write, scoring, dedup)

### Changed
- Scoring algorithm requires at least 1 skill-worthy type (gotcha/decision/how-it-works/problem-solution/trade-off) — pure discovery/what-changed entities won't generate skills
- Volume bonus reduced from 2×obs to 1×obs (capped at 5) to favor quality over quantity
- Type diversity bonus increased from 2 to 3 points per unique skill-worthy type

### Fixed
- 422 tests passing (up from 405), 34 test files, zero regressions

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Antigravity Adapter**: Full support for Antigravity/Gemini IDE (MCP config + rules)
- **Copilot Adapter**: VS Code Copilot MCP config adapter + rules format adapter
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: 7 developer docs in `docs/` (Architecture, Modules, API Reference, Design Decisions, Development Guide, Known Issues & Roadmap, AI Context)
- **8 new npm keywords**: antigravity, mcp-tool, memory-layer, ai-memory, progressive-disclosure, orama, vector-search, bm25
- `prepublishOnly` now runs `npm test` in addition to build

### Changed
- README completely rewritten with clearer structure, npx zero-install setup, 6 agent configs, comparison table, Progressive Disclosure example, and architecture diagram
- `description` field expanded for better npm search ranking
- `files` array cleaned up (removed unused `examples` directory)

### Fixed
- 274 tests passing (up from 219), zero regressions

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-14

### Core
- Knowledge Graph: Entity-Relation-Observation model (MCP Official compatible)
- 3-Layer Progressive Disclosure: compact search → timeline → detail
- 9 observation types with icon classification
- Full-text search via Orama (BM25)
- Per-project isolation via Git remote detection
- 14 MCP tools (9 official + 5 Memorix extensions)

### Cross-Agent Sync
- Rules Parser: 4 format adapters (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf)
- Rules Syncer: scan → deduplicate → conflict detection → cross-format generation
- Workspace Sync: MCP config migration + workflow sync + apply with backup/rollback

### Intelligence (Competitor-Inspired)
- Access tracking: accessCount + lastAccessedAt (from mcp-memory-service)
- Token budget: maxTokens search trimming (from MemCP)
- Memory decay: exponential decay + retention lifecycle + immunity (from mcp-memory-service + MemCP)
- Entity extraction: regex-based file/module/URL/CamelCase extraction (from MemCP)
- Auto-enrichment: memorix_store auto-extracts and enriches concepts/files
- Causal detection: "because/due to/caused by" pattern detection
- Auto-relations: implicit Knowledge Graph relation creation (causes/fixes/modifies)
- Retention status: memorix_retention MCP tool

### Vector Search
- Embedding provider abstraction layer (extensible)
- fastembed integration (optional, local ONNX, 384-dim bge-small)
- Orama hybrid search mode (BM25 + vector)
- Graceful degradation: no fastembed → fulltext only
- Embedding cache (5000 entries LRU)

### Agent Instructions
- CLAUDE.md: Claude Code usage instructions + lifecycle hooks
- Example configs for Cursor, Windsurf, Codex
